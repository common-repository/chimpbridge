Create and send Mailchimp Campaigns right inside of the WordPress admin.

== Description ==

## Send Campaigns to Your MailChimp Audience in WordPress

Easily create and send a Mailchimp newsletter from right inside of Wordpress. The Mailchimp native interface isn't for everyone. Less technical users, especially clients who write their own organization's newsletter, might be more comfortable creating content in WordPress.

ChimpBridge allows those users to connect their WordPress admin directly to Mailchimp. From there they can write, edit, and preview their Mailchimp campaigns in an interface they are already comfortable using.

## Make Collaboration on Mailchimp Newsletters Easier
One of the great parts of WordPress is how useful it is to create drafts of contents. Multiple users can work together on a piece of content before publishing. That experience can now be used with Mailchimp campaigns and newsletters! Use ChimpBridge to give multiple writers access to a single campaign before it is send to your Mailchimp audience.

## Limit Access to Your Mailchimp Account
Another great part of using ChimpBridge is that the plugin allows you to limit who has access to the full seat of features available in Mailchimp.

Content creators, the ones responsible for the actual content of your Mailchimp newsletters, don't need to access everything on Mailchimp.com to do their jobs. ChimpBridge exposes them to the core pieces of Mailchimp that they need to do their job: create, preview, and send newsletters and campaigns to your audiences.

## A Great Tool for Email Marketing
ChimpBridge is the ideal WordPress plugin for companies and organizations looking to get involved in email marketing. By making the newsletter writing interface familiar, you are more likely to actively write and send emails to your email marketing list.
